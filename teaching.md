# Jacob D. Moses
![Photo of Jacob Moses leading a session at a teaching and learning conference at Harvard University.][image-1] I have taught students in introductory survey courses in the history of science, general education courses on medical ethics and the history of medicine, and advanced seminars on the cultural history of stigma in medicine. I have mentored students through intensive research tutorials on historical methods and advised several senior thesis projects. I have also taught medical students in courses on the history of social medicine.

I am interested in seeking out innovative methods of teaching and assessing learning. I was an inaugural pedagogy fellow at the Edmond J. Safra Center of Ethics at Harvard University, where I focused on project-based learning and syllabus design. I have taught in flipped-classroom models and co-designed workshop courses centered on the development of student projects.

I have received six Certificates of Distinction in Teaching from the Bok Center for Teaching and Learning for my teaching at Harvard College.
