# Jacob D. Moses, Ph.D.
**Teaching**

![Photo of Jacob Moses leading a session at a teaching and learning conference at Harvard University.][image-1] I am a committed teacher. I have taught students in introductory survey courses in the history of medicine, history of science, general education courses on medical ethics and medical history, and advanced seminars on the cultural history of stigma in medicine. I have mentored students through intensive research tutorials on historical methods and advised several senior thesis projects. At the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, I have led courses in the history of medicine, supervised masters-level research projects, and taught medical students in courses on social medicine.

I seek out innovative methods of teaching and assessing inclusive learning that promotes diversity and equity. I was an inaugural pedagogy fellow at the [Edmond J. Safra Center of Ethics at Harvard University][1], where I focused on project-based learning and syllabus design. I have taught in flipped-classroom models and co-designed workshop courses centered on the development of student projects.

For my teaching at Harvard College, I was awarded six Certificates of Distinction in Teaching from the Bok Center for Teaching and Learning.
