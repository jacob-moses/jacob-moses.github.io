# Jacob D. Moses  
**Postdoctoral Researcher, History of Science, Technology & Medicine, Johns Hopkins University**

![Photo of Jacob Moses outside in front of trees and a brick wall.][image-1]I study biomedicine and biotechnology in the 20th and 21st centuries, with a particular focus on issues of ethics and governance. My research and teaching interests include the history of medicine; science & technology studies; the history of emotions in science, technology, and medicine; medical decision-making; the history of surgery; gender, sexuality, and the body; and bioethics. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University’s [Institute of the History of Medicine][1] and [Center for Medical Humanities and Social Medicine][2].

My current book project, _Medical Regret without Remorse_, traces the history of therapeutic reversals in surgical practice from the mid-20th century to the present, offering a new account of how affect plays a role both among patients and medical professionals in shaping the current regime of biomedicine. In this work, I develop a concept of “medical regret” to illuminate bureaucratic and affective responses to medical harm.

I earned my Ph.D. in [History of Science from Harvard University][3] (2020), where I also completed a secondary field in [Science, Technology, and Society][4]. My work has received support from the E. J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University, the National Science Foundation, and the Science History Institute (formerly Chemical Heritage Foundation), among others.

Before pursuing my doctoral studies, I worked for several years at[ The Hastings Center][5] on interdisciplinary bioethics research projects ranging from pandemic preparedness to the ethics of synthetic biology.
