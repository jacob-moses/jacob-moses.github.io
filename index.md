![Photo of Jacob Moses outside in front of trees and a brick wall.][image-1] Jacob Moses's research and teaching centers on the intersection of the history of medicine and public health, bioethics, and science & technology studies (STS). He studies biomedicine, public health, and biotechnology in the 20th and 21st centuries, with a particular focus on issues of ethics and governance. He is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Bioethics & Health Humanities at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.

Dr. Moses is currently a principal investigator of the National Science Foundation-funded research project, "Collaborative Research: Behavioral Science and the Making of the Right-Reasoning Public Health Citizenry."

His current book project, _Medical Regret without Remorse_, traces the history of therapeutic reversals in surgical practice from the mid-20th century to the present. In this research, he seeks to illuminate bureaucratic and affective responses to medical harm and develop a new account of how affect plays a role both among patients, medical professionals, and public health officials in shaping the current regime of biomedicine.

He received his Ph.D. in [History of Science from Harvard University][3] (2020), where he also earned a secondary field in [Science, Technology, and Society][4]. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship in Medical Humanities and Social Medicine at [Johns Hopkins University][2]. His work has received support from the E. J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University, the National Science Foundation, and the Science History Institute (formerly Chemical Heritage Foundation). 

Before pursuing his doctoral studies, he worked for several years at [ The Hastings Center][5] on interdisciplinary bioethics research and public outreach projects ranging from pandemic preparedness to the ethics of synthetic biology.
