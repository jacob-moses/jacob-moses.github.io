# Hi there, I’m Jacob Moses
I study biomedicine and biotechnology in the 20th and 21st centuries, with a particular focus on issues of ethics and governance. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at [Johns Hopkins University’s Institute of the History of Medicine][1] and [Center for Medical Humanities and Social Medicine][2]. 

I earned my PhD in [History of Science at Harvard University][3], where I also completed a secondary field in [Science, Technology, and Society][4]. 

After graduating from [Vassar College][5], I worked for several years at[ The Hastings Center][6] on interdisciplinary bioethics research projects ranging from pandemic preparedness to synthetic biology.
