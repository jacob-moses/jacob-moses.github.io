# Hi there, Iâ€™m Jacob Moses
I study biomedicine and biotechnology in the 20th and 21st centuries, with a particular interest in issues of ethics and governance. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University at the Institute of the History of Medicine and Center for Medical Humanities and Social Medicine. I completed my PhD in History of Science at Harvard University, where I also earned a secondary field in Science, Technology, and Society Studies. After graduating from Vassar College, I worked for six years at The Hastings Center on a range of interdisciplinary bioethics research projects.
