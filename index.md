**Postdoctoral Researcher, History of Science, Technology & Medicine**

![][image-1]I study biomedicine and biotechnology in the 20th and 21st centuries, with a particular focus on issues of ethics and governance. At Johns Hopkins University, I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Institute of the History of Medicine][1] and [Center for Medical Humanities and Social Medicine][2]. 

I earned my PhD in [History of Science at Harvard University][3], where I also completed a secondary field in [Science, Technology, and Society][4]. 

Before pursuing my doctoral studies, I worked for several years at[Â The Hastings Center][5] on interdisciplinary bioethics research projects ranging from pandemic preparedness to synthetic biology.

For further details, [see my CV][6].
