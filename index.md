# Hi there, I’m Jacob Moses
I study biomedicine and biotechnology in the 20th and 21st centuries, with a particular focus on issues of ethics and governance. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University at the Institute of the History of Medicine and Center for Medical Humanities and Social Medicine. I completed my PhD in [History of Science at Harvard University][1], where I also earned a secondary field in [Science, Technology, and Society][2]. After graduating from [Vassar College][3], I worked for several years at[ The Hastings Center][4] on interdisciplinary bioethics research projects ranging from pandemic preparedness to synthetic biology.
